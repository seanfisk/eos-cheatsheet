\begin{block}{Using the clipboard}
  When you copy or paste in a desktop environment, you use the X11 clipboard. The contents of the X11 clipboard can be accessed and modified through the terminal using a utility called xclip.
  \begin{indented}
    \begin{bashcode*}{gobble=6}
      alias copy='xclip -selection clipboard -in'
      alias paste='xclip -selection clipboard -out'
      echo 'EOS Rocks' | copy # Set clipboard to 'EOS Rocks'
      copy < eos.txt          # Set clipboard to contents of eos.txt
      paste > eos.txt         # Write clipboard contents to eos.txt
    \end{bashcode*}
  \end{indented}
\end{block}
