\begin{block}{Inter-EOS password-less SSH}
  Secure Shell is a protocol that is used to remotely control machines. Under normal circumstances, you must type a password to log in. However, by setting up trust, no password is necessary to SSH between EOS machines.

      \begin{bashcode*}{gobble=8}

  For more security, use a passphrase and \clicode{ssh-agent}.
