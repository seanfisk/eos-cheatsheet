 Writing Style
===============

When writing technical documentation, it is important to follow a consistent writing style. Within this manual, we attempt to follow the `OpenStack writing conventions`_. Their documentation presents a great summary of how to write coherent technical documentation.

Sphinx uses SmartyPants_ to transform quotes, dashes, and ellipses into typographically correct entities for HTML output. You can use straight quotes, straight apostrophes, and three dots --- they will be transformed into the correct characters. For dashes, first read up on `the three types of dash`_. The transformations are as follows: Hyphens stay as is, two hyphens will be transformed into an en dash, and three hyphens will be transformed into an em dash.
