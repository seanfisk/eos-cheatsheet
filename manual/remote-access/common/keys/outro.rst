When you SSH into EOS now, you should be able to do so without having to provide a password::

   ssh smithj@eos01.cis.gvsu.edu

.. note::

   In this setup, we created our public/private key pair without a passphrase, which is less secure. If you would like to use a passphrase, please see `Mark Hershberger's excellent guide to ssh-agent`_ and `Github's guide to SSH passphrases`_.
