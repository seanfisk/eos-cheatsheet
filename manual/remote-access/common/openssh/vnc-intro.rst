To create the tunnel, use the following command line::

   ssh -L 5900:eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu:REMOTE_PORT smithj@eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu

Or the following configuration file:

.. code-block:: apacheconf

   Host eosvnc
   HostName eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu
   User smithj
   LocalForward 5900 eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu:REMOTE_PORT

If you used the configuration file, run the following to create the tunnel::

   ssh eosvnc

You are now ready to tunnel your VNC session.
