The ``ssh`` program needs to be told to initiate X forwarding when the connection is started. This can be done with the ``-X`` command-line flag::

    ssh -X smithj@eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu

This can also be accomplished in the SSH configuration file:

.. code-block:: apacheconf

    Host eosx
    HostName eos01.cis.gvsu.edu
    User smithj
    ForwardX11 yes
