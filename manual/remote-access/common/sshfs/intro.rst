SSHFS
=====

A further alternative to transferring files is to use the Secure Shell Filesystem, SSHFS_. SSHFS is based on Filesystem in Userspace, FUSE_. By using SSHFS, you can mount your EOS home directory on your local machine as a separate drive. This allows you to in effect run programs within your local machine on files within your EOS account. It is very similar to editing files on a flash drive. SSHFS can be used for any purpose, but is especially useful for web development on EOS.
