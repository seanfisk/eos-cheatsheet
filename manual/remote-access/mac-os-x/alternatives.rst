 Alternative Clients
=====================

Chicken is not the only VNC viewer available for Mac OS X. Some alternatives are:

.. Note: We've considered using TigerVNC over Chicken as the primary client for Mac OS X. TigerVNC has no connection problems and is actively maintained. Chicken, on the other hand, has the issue with the ZRLE encoding and appears inactive. However, TigerVNC's interface is unintuitive, unattractive, and in general inferior to Chicken's. Given these tradeoffs, we've decided to stay with Chicken. If TigerVNC gets better or Chicken gets worse, we should consider switching to TigerVNC again.

* `TigerVNC <http://tigervnc.org/>`_ is a capable free and open source VNC viewer. Its interface is not as Mac-friendly as Chicken, but it works well. If you are having problems with Chicken, try TigerVNC.
* `RealVNC Viewer <http://realvnc.com/download/viewer/>`_ is a freeware viewer, but requires registration. RealVNC also offers `RealVNC Viewer for Google Chrome <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc-viewer-for-google-chr/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla?hl=en>`_, a free Google Chrome extension which does not require registration.
* `JollysFastVNC <http://www.jinx.de/JollysFastVNC.html>`_ is a full-featured VNC client with trial and paid versions available.
* `Chicken of the VNC <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/>`_ is an older version of Chicken and is not recommended.
