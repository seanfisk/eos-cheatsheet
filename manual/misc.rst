Miscellaneous
=============

This section contains tips that are useful but are not at home in the other sections.

Kill the X Server
=================

If another user has a session on a computer you would like to use, it is possible to log them out and return to the login screen. The key combination :kbd:`Control-Alt-Backspace` kills the :wikipedia:`X server <X_Window_System>`, which ends the current user's desktop session. This is also useful should your session crash or freeze.

.. warning::

   Be advised that any of the current user's unsaved data will be lost.

Directory Navigation
====================

These tools help you navigate directories quickly.

pushd
-----

The command :samp:`pushd {dir}` will save your current directory on the stack and move you to :cmd:`dir`.

popd
----

After you have used :cmd:`pushd` and stored one or more directories on the stack, you can use :cmd:`popd` to move back to your previous directory.

dirs
----

:cmd:`dirs` allows you to see what directories you have stored on the stack. The far left directory is the most recently saved. Another way to view the directory from most recent to least recent is by using the command ``dirs -v``.

xdg-open
========

xdg-open_ is a command that can be used to open a file or URL in the user's preferred application.
Example:``xdg-open myfile.pdf``

.. _xdg-open: http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html

.. _uptime:

uptime
======

The command :cmd:`uptime` will display the following information in one line: the current time, the amount of time the system has been running, the number of users currently logged in, and system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

User Interactions
=================

w
-

The :cmd:`w` command provides a summary of the current users on the machine. The header displays the same information as the :ref:`uptime` command.

last
----

:cmd:`last` displays all the users that have logged into the machine since the creation of the :wikipedia:`wtmp log file <Utmp>`. The date and time that file was created is shown at the bottom of the output. To limit the output to the last 10 logins, use ``last -10``.

users
-----

:cmd:`users` displays a list of all the users currently logged in to a host.

.. _write:

write
-----

The :cmd:`write` command allows communication with other logged-in users through the terminal. It copies typed lines from your terminal to theirs, and if they wish to reply they must also use the :cmd:`write` command. The usual syntax is :samp:`write {username}`. Any subsequent lines entered will be copied to the user's terminal. To terminate :cmd:`write` use :kbd:`Control-D`.

mesg
----

To control whether someone can :ref:`write` to your terminal use the :cmd:`mesg` command. By default :cmd:`write` is allowed, to turn it off use ``mesg n``.

xclip
=====

X Windows is the graphical subsytem underlying GNU/Linux desktop managers such as GNOME and KDE. X Windos has two clipboards: ``PRIMARY`` and ``CLIPBOARD``. Data is stored to ``PRIMARY`` when it is highlighted. Data is stored to ``CLIPBOARD`` when it is highlighted and explicitly copied. xsel is another program that can be used simularly to xclip but is not covered here.
 
* To display the information in clipboard use ``xclip -selection clipboard -out``.
* To display the information stored in primary use :cmd:`xclip -out` because it
  is default or ``xclip -selection primary -out``. 
* Clicking the middle mouse button will also paste what is in the clipboard. 
* To save the contents of the clipboard to a file use
  ``xclip -out > ~/filename.txt``. 
* A full list of commands can be found by using ``man xclip``.
* It is recomended to use aliases with xclip.
* Alias to paste clipboard ``alias clipout='xclip -selection clipboard -out'``.
* Alias to copy to clipboard ``alias clipin='xclip -selection clipboard -in'``.
