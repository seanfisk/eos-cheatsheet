 Mastering EOS
===============

Mastering EOS is an initiative to produce better documentation for the Grand Valley State University School of Computer and Information Systems Exploratory Operating System Labs (GVSU CIS EOS Labs). It is intended to augment the `original EOS documentation`_ located on the School of CIS website.

..
   Mastering EOS consists of two parts:

   * A poster of lesser-known tips and tricks that can be used in the EOS Lab.
   * A full manual documenting both basic and advanced tasks.

Mastering EOS is written by:

* Sean Fisk, BS and MS in Computer Science from GVSU
* Ira Woodring, GVSU EOS Lab system administrator
