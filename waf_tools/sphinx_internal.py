"""Waf tool for building documentation with Sphinx.

This version works really well with with Waf at the cost of staggering
complexity.

Tested with Waf 1.8.5 and Sphinx 1.2.3.

Based on
- https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/blob/python/.mywaflib/waflib/extras/sphinx_build.py
- http://docs.waf.googlecode.com/git/book_17/single.html#_a_compiler_producing_source_files_with_names_unknown_in_advance

TODO: Multiple builders could potentially use a shared doctrees directory and
also share scanner method results. Unfortunately, that would likely mean
combining all of the builders into one task, which is ugly and would probably
decrease parallelism. Other options would be to run the dependency scanner
before creating the task (creating potentially incorrect results) or caching
the results of the scan (which would result in concurrency control, and be ugly
and error-prone).
