This directory is for LaTeX packages that we are using that are not present in the full TeXLive installation on EOS. The full TeXLive installation was installed with:

    yum install texlive-*

For Sphinx 1.2.3, the LaTeX builder began requiring `upquote.sty`, which is not present in the full TeXLive installation.

All the rest of the files are for the poster.

In general, we only put the generated files in here.
